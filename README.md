## Abstract
The objective of this study is to explore Machine and Deep Learning techniques for
the classification of orthodontic images according to the correct dental alignment
treatment. The aligner company Sorridi will provide photos taken by dentists to
patients for whom a photo pre-evaluation has been requested. This process is used
to determine the necessary treatment and therefore have an estimate of duration and
cost and is currently manual, the goal will therefore be to automate it by developing
a machine learning model that will be able to correctly assign the treatment. The
model will be trained and tested on the images of about 2500 patients collected
from 2018 to date, for each patient a variable number of photos of different nature
may appear (full frontal mouth, right lateral, left lateral, upper arch only, lower arch
only ...). The types of treatment performed, "Soft", "Semi-Medium", "Medium",
"Semi-Hard" and "Hard" are determined by various factors such as the positioning,
overlap and rotation of the teeth. Different approaches will be attempted based
both on a preprocessing of the images that can even include the segmentation of
the teeth only to give more emphasis to the dental structure, and on leaving the
images "raw" as other factors such as gums health can also play an important role
in determining the responsiveness of the teeth to the alignment.
